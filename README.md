# Snake Game 🐍
This is a classic Snake Game built using Python's turtle module. The game is developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and is divided into multiple files for better organization and readability. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food to gain points, and avoid collisions with walls or the snake's own body.

# Features 🎮
Modular Design: The game is organized into separate files:
game.py: Controls the main game loop and logic.
snake.py: Manages the snake's behavior (movement, growth, collisions).
food.py: Handles the random generation of food on the screen.
score.py: Displays and updates the player's score.
Player Feedback: The player's score is displayed on the screen.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
OOP Concepts: Fully implemented using Object-Oriented Programming for scalability.
# How to Play 🕹️
Run the game.py file to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Eat the food (small colored dots) to increase your score and the snake's length.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body to keep playing.
